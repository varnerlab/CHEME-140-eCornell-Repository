    "# Activity: Let's Break the Student Record Application\n",
    "There is a big difference between writing code that only you will use and writing code that others will use. When you write code for others, you need to make sure that it is easy to use,and robust enough to handle unexpected inputs. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this activity, you will be given a code base, in particular the `build(...)` and `find(...)` methods from the student records app, that is not robust and has some bugs. Some of these bugs ae can fix, while others are just errors in user logic. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our task is to break the code by providing unexpected inputs, look at how the system reacts (who is doing what) and then suggest fixes to make it more robust for items that we can control. Let's go!\n",

Additonally, mutable types offer different possible initialization options, such as default values for fields.\n",
