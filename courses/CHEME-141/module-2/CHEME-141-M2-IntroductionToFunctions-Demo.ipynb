    "# Introduction to Functions\n",
    "In this demonstration, we will explore the concept of functions in programming, how to define them, how to check for errors (more on this later), how to pass data to them and get results back. \n",
    "* _What are functions_? A function in programming is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task when called. Functions have thier own _scope_ (memory namespace), and typically takes inputs (arguments), processes them, and may return an output.\n",
    "* _Why use functions_? Functions help organize code, promote reusability, and make it easier to read and maintain. They allow you to break down complex problems into smaller, manageable pieces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of us are familiar with functions from mathematics, $f:A\\rightarrow B$ where $A$ is the domain (input) and $B$ is the codomain (output). Functions in programming work similarly but can also result in side effects, such as modifying variables in global scope, printing output, or interacting with external systems. Thus, they are more then pure mappings from inputs to outputs.\n",

    "A function is declared using a opening keyword of some type, followed by the function name, parentheses for parameters (arguments), and a block of code that defines what the function does. Finally, it may return a value using a return statement or implicitly return the last evaluated expression, and then a closing statement or keyword to indicate the end of the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the programming language, the syntax for defining a function may vary:\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Julia__: Functions in Julia are defined using the `function` keyword or with the shorter `f(x) = expression` syntax.  Arguments are enclosed in parentheses, and the function body can span multiple lines.  Julia functions can return values explicitly with `return` or implicitly by evaluating the last expression; return types can be annotated using `::ReturnType`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Python__: Functions in Python start with the `def` keyword followed by the function name and arguments in parentheses. The function body is defined using indentation, and values are returned using the `return` statement. Python functions do not require explicit return type declarations but support optional type hints using `-> ReturnType`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- __C__: Functions in C are defined by specifying the return type, function name, and a comma-separated list of typed arguments inside parentheses.  The function body is enclosed in braces `{}` and must return a value of the declared return type using the `return` statement. Unlike Julia and Python, C requires all types to be declared explicitly and does not support default arguments or type inference."

    "#### Arguments and multiple dispatch\n",
    "In Julia, functions can accept various types of arguments, including positional, keyword, and optional arguments. Let's review these concepts:\n",
    "* __Positional arguments__ are the most common and must be provided in the order defined in the function signature. This is the traditional way of passing arguments to functions, where the caller must match the order, type and number of parameters defined in the function.\n",
    "* __Optional positional arguments__ in Julia are defined by assigning default values in the function signature, allowing callers to omit them and rely on the specified defaults. \n",
    "* __Keyword arguments__, placed after a semicolon in the signature, must be passed by name and can also have default values, providing clearer and more flexible calls. Both forms integrate with Julia’s multiple dispatch, enabling methods to specialize based on the presence, names, or types of provided arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, in the example above, how did Julia know to call the for or while loop implementatiom of the private `_fibonacci(...)` method logic? This is a concept called _multiple dispatch_:\n",
    "* __Multiple dispatch__ is a paradigm where the implementation of a function is chosen based on the runtime types of all its arguments rather than just one, enabling highly generic and extensible code; Julia uses this natively, while other languages (e.g., Python or C#) offer multimethods or limited support for similar behavior using external libraries."
