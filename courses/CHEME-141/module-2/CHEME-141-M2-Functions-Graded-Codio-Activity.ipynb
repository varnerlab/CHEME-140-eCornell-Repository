    "__Hmmmm__: With only 100 samples, this does not look like a normal distribution! Why? The [`histogram(...)` method](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/UnicodePlots.jl.git) is plotting the samples as a histogram, but we don't enough samples! Let's generate more samples, say 1000, or 10000, and see if the histogram looks more like a normal distribution.\n",
    "* _Increase the number of samples?_ When we do more samples, e.g., 10000 samples and `nbins = 20` we see a histogram that looks like a normal distribution. This is because the more samples we take, the closer we get to the true distribution of the data. It looks like we are on the right track!\n",
    "* _Increase the number of bins?_ When we increase the number of bins, we see a more detailed histogram, but it also becomes more noisy. There are several rules of thumb for choosing the number of bins, such as the [Sturges' rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturges%27s_rule?utm_source=chatgpt.com) or the [Rice rule](hhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram?utm_source=chatgpt.com#Rice_rule). We've implemented both of these rules above, which one do you think is better? The Sturges' rule is more conservative, while the Rice rule is more aggressive. It depends on the data and the context, but in general, the Rice rule is more suitable for larger datasets, while the Sturges' rule is more suitable for smaller datasets."
