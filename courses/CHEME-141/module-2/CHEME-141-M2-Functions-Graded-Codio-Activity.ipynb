For example, we can call `build(Normal)` without specifying values for the mean and standard deviation arguments.

The [`histogram(...)` method](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/UnicodePlots.jl.git) is plotting the samples as a histogram, but we don't have enough samples! Let's generate more samples, say 1000 or 10000, and see if the histogram resembles a normal distribution.\n",

    "* _Increase the number of bins?_ When we increase the number of bins, we see a more detailed histogram, which also becomes noisier. There are several rules of thumb for choosing the number of bins, such as the [Sturges' rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturges%27s_rule?utm_source=chatgpt.com) or the [Rice rule](hhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram?utm_source=chatgpt.com#Rice_rule). We've implemented both of these rules above. Which one do you think is better? Sturges' rule is more conservative, while Rice's is more aggressive.
