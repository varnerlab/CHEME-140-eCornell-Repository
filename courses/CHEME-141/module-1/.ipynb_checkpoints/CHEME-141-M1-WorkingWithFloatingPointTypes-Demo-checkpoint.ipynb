    "# Demo: A Deeper Dive into Numbers and Floating Point Types\n",
    "We work with numerical data in many tasks in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Thus, let's explore common floating-point data types, how they are represented in memory, and the precision associated with each type.\n",
    "* __Key (surprising) fact__: All floating point numbers are approximations! A floating-point number uses a _fixed number of bits_, i.e., memory to store a value, so it can only represent a finite set of rational values rather than the continuum of real numbers. Thus, any real number must be rounded to the nearest floating-point value, making every floating-point value an approximation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The typical floating-point number types you will likely encounter in applications are `Float16`, `Float32`, and `Float64`. But what do these numbers mean? For example, what do the `16`, `32`, and `64` mean in `FloatXX`, what precision can these numbers describe, and how are they represented in memory?\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer these questions, we need to establish a few ground truths. First, on regular, i.e., non-quantum hardware, all floating-point numbers are stored as binary numbers, i.e., numbers written in base `2`. Let's start by looking at the representation of base `b` numbers."
