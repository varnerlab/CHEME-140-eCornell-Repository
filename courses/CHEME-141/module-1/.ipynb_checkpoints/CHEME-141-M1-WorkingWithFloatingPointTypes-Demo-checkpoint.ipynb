    "# Demo: A Deeper Dive into Floating Point Types\n",
    "We work with numerical data in many tasks in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Thus, let's explore common floating-point data types, how they are represented in memory, and the precision associated with each type.\n",
    "* __Key (surprising) fact__: All floating point numbers are approximations! A floating-point number uses a _fixed number of bits_, i.e., memory to store a value, so it can only represent a finite set of rational values rather than the continuum of real numbers. Thus, any real number must be rounded to the nearest floating-point value, making every floating-point value an approximation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The typical floating-point number types you will likely encounter in applications are `Float16`, `Float32`, and `Float64`. But what do these numbers mean? For example, what do the `16`, `32`, and `64` mean in `FloatXX`, what precision can these numbers describe, and how are they represented in memory?\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer these questions, we need to establish a few ground truths. First, on regular, i.e., non-quantum hardware, all floating-point numbers are stored as binary numbers, i.e., numbers written in base `2`. Let's start by looking at the representation of base `b` numbers."

    "A number in base $b$ is represented by a finite sequence of digits $(d_{n}d_{n-1}\\dots{d_{1}}d_{0})_{b}$ where each digit $d_{i}$ satifies $0\\leq{d_{i}}<b$. The value (in base 10) of a base b number is the positional sum:\n",

    "Consider an `Int64` number. We know that memory storage on modern non-quantum hardware is binary, i.e., base $b = 2$; thus, all the digits $d_{i}$ must be $0\\leq{d}_{i}<2$. However, how many digits do we have, i.e., what is the value of $n$? This is the _word size_, i.e., the `64` in `Int64`.\n",
    "* __Hmmm__. Didn't we already see that? Yes, it's the length of the string output from [the `bitstring(...)` method](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/base/numbers/#Base.bitstring)! Let's count the number of zero digits and the number of one digits of a test 64-bit integer using the [`count_zeros(...)` method](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/base/numbers/#Base.count_zeros) and [`count_ones(...)` method](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/base/numbers/#Base.count_ones)"
