    "# Demo: Data Types\n",
    "In a computer program, all data that we use, manipulate, generate, etc, has a type, which is a member of a type system. A type system provides a formal way to classify and constrain the shapes of data and operations in a program, enabling the detection of mismatches (e.g., passing a string where a number is expected) before or during execution. \n",
    "\n",
    "* _Modern languages_: Modern languages such as [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) and [Python](https://www.python.org/) utilize dynamic type systems, where type checks occur during execution. This allows for greater flexibility at the expense of deferred error detection.\n",
    "* _Classical languages_: In contrast, [classical languages such as the C programming language](https://gcc.gnu.org/) feature a static, compile-time type system: types must be explicitly declared, checks are enforced prior to execution, and the compiler uses type information to generate optimized code and prevent many categories of runtime errors.\n",
    "* _Is Julia Like C or Python_? It's like both! Julia is dynamically typed like [Python](https://www.python.org/) in \n",
    "that type checks happen at run‐time. However, [the Julia compiler](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/devdocs/compiler/) performs type inference on concrete values and generates specialized, statically‐typed machine code for performance, i.e., sort of like [the C programming language](https://gcc.gnu.org/). Thus, although Julia code is compiled, its language semantics remain dynamically typed."

    "## Primitive Data Types\n",
    "A primitive data type is a basic, built‐in data type provided by a programming language whose values are represented atomically; primitive types are not composed of other types.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Julia, primitive types like `Int64`, `Float64`, `Bool`, and `Char` are fixed‐size, _unboxed machine types_ used directly by the compiler. In contrast, built‐in types such as int, float, and bool in Python are heap‐allocated [PyObject instances](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/structures.html#c.PyObject).\n",
    "* _Unboxed machine types_? An unboxed type is one whose values are stored directly in memory (e.g., [in registers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processor_register) or on the stack) without an extra level of indirection or heap allocation.\n",
    "* _Stack and heap_? The stack is a region of memory used for storing function call frames, local variables, and control flow information in a last‐in, first‐out manner, with automatic allocation and deallocation as functions are entered and exited. The heap is a separate memory region for dynamically allocated objects whose lifetimes are managed manually or by a garbage collector, allowing arbitrary allocation and deallocation but incurring overhead for bookkeeping.\n",
    "* _Stack faster than heap_? Accessing stack memory is generally faster because it involves simple pointer arithmetic and a contiguous, cache‐friendly layout without extra metadata lookup. Heap access requires managing allocation metadata and may involve pointer dereferencing and less predictable locality, which can introduce overhead.\n",
    "\n",

In most languages, arrays occupy a single block of memory, with the index of the first element typically at 0 or 1. Accessing element i corresponds to computing the base address plus i times the memory size of the elements. \n",

Python’s native lists are heterogeneous and zero-indexed, while [NumPy’s homogeneous arrays](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.array.html) are zero-indexed and row-major (but are implemented in a separate C library rather than the core language).\n",
